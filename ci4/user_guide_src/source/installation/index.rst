Installation
############

CodeIgniter4 can be installed in a number of different ways: manually,
using `Composer <https://getcomposer.org>`_, or using
`Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_.
Which is right for you?

- If you would like the simple "download & go" install that CodeIgniter3
  is known for, choose the manual installation.
- If you plan to add third party packages to your project, we
  recommend the Composer installation.
- If you are thinking of contributing to the framework,
  then the Git installation is right for you.
